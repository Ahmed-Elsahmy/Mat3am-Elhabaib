🚀 Just Launched: Mata3m ElHabaib – Full-Stack Restaurant Management System 🍽️

I'm excited to share my latest full-stack web application built with ASP.NET MVC, designed to manage both customer interactions and restaurant admin operations.

🔹 Project Name: Mata3m ElHabaib
🔹 Key Features:

🍕 Dynamic menu system organized by food categories (e.g., pizza, chicken, etc.)

🛒 Users can browse the menu, place orders, and book tables online

⭐ Users can rate the restaurant for better feedback

🔄 Real-time admin panel to view incoming orders and manage them

✍️ Admins can add/edit/delete menu items and categories

👥 Full user management system, including the ability to add new admin accounts

🔧 Technologies & Concepts Used:

✅ ASP.NET MVC (with Clear Architecture: Controllers, Services, Repositories)

✅ Entity Framework + LINQ for data access

✅ SQL Server for database management

✅ Authentication & Authorization with role-based access (Admin & User)

✅ Dependency Injection (DI)

✅ Bootstrap for responsive design

✅ JavaScript & AJAX for seamless user experience (e.g., loading menu dynamically, image previews)

This project has helped me strengthen my understanding of enterprise-level web development and best practices in code organization, scalability, and security.

🧠 Always learning, always building.

I'd love to hear your feedback or answer any questions!
